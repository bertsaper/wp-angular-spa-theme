# wp-angular-spa-theme

This theme combines the ease and functionality of the WordPress CMS with the practicality of Angular.js code, an open-source framework developed by Google. It was "Forked" from https://github.com/nicopinto/wp-spa-boilerplate, compiled and then modified to handle partial includes.

This theme allows only pages to be created. Posts are not allowed.

For this theme to work, WordPress Settings | Permalink Settings must be set for "Post name" and your menu under Appearance | Menus must have Menu Settings | Theme locations | Primary Menu selected.

Enter content as you would any WordPress installation. The steps are:

Go to the Pages area and select or add a page.
Create or edit your content.
Please Note: Page titles must be longer than 5 characters.
Click "Publish" or "Update."
Click "Preview."
Review your content on the Preview page.
Add your page to the menu by going to Appearance|Menus.
Please Note: Sending a page to the "Trash" will not delete menu listing. Entering the "Trash" area and deleting the post will update the menu.
The Preview page will not look like the page that displays for visitors. It will show the text and images that will be formatted for visitors.

Known Issue: The preview page will sometimes be overtaken by the angular directives. That is, the Preview ID and Nonce will disappear as the page redirects to home. The longer the content, the less likely this is to occur.
